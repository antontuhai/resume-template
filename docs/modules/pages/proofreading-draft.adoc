“The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.” — Picasso.

Increasingly, as we age, the word “legacy” inevitably pops up more and more in conversation. The usual agreed meaning of “legacy” is something you leave behind after you die, whether it be money, a charity, or a way of thinking. These are all things worthy of your full consideration; however, they are not what I have in mind when I use the term “living legacy” for MindSwitch.

Your living legacy—and we all have one whether we want to or not—is what you choose to display, our character, if you will, through your day-to-day actions to all the eyes that are watching you. What behaviors, habits, and traits are you displaying to your friends, family, and community? Will you model active or sedentary living? Will you be fixed-minded or relentlessly curious, approachable or withdrawn, generous or stingy, loving or closed, caring or self-centered, and so on?

Why should this matter to you? You should care because there are so many sets of eyes watching and observing you, so many pairs of ears listening to and learning from you—just like you watched and heard when you were younger and perhaps still do today. Can you remember a parent or older relative who sat around and let the world go by? Conversely, can you remember someone who embraced life fully and was almost ageless? So many people observe you from the sidelines, taking conscious and subconscious cues on how they will approach their lives today and in the future, for you are demonstrating what they think is possible for them.

Earlier, I told you about my “Pa,” my grandfather on my mother’s side, sitting in his chair, smoking, while we children were to be seen but not heard as he listened to the news. He was 67 when he passed, but he seemed ancient to us kids. He was my first relative to give me clues as to what aging was like. It was a time of watching TV and listening to the radio, smoking, and drinking. I knew he had been an active outdoorsman when he was younger, but I couldn’t see it. I concluded he must have left that guy at the side of the road long ago.

Conversely, I first met my aunt Cora from California when she flew to Toronto at 88. She was completely blind. A spirit more full of life you would be hard-pressed to find. Even though I only met her once, her legacy from that meeting has dramatically impacted my life by helping me see that you shouldn’t allow yourself to be defined by deficiencies but should push forward and work around them. I became close with her daughter Jean, who had taken cues from her mom, and, boy, did she live life fully, from working as a nurse in Egypt to driving us to the Hollywood Bowl to see a concert when she was 77 in her four-wheel-drive Jeep no less.

If the saying “the apple does not fall far from the tree” has substantial truth, can we also agree with some vigor that there are times we wish this were not the case? Often unknowingly, we have all found ourselves following in the footsteps of our parents, older siblings, or friends. And that due to nothing more than the power of physical proximity, these people influence us to display the same habits (good and bad) and ambitions (or the lack of), even though we sometimes wish they didn’t. Reflect on the last time you, your partner, a sibling, or a friend said, “You sound just like your mom” or “That is just what your father would have done.” The trail we often follow in life is at least partially authored by the unconscious habits we have taken on as our own, absorbed from others.

Make no mistake: we all create a living legacy. There is no getting around it. As the term implies, your living legacy does not mean your personal highlight reel after your demise but something far more intimate. Whether it is authoring a way of living life, a cause that we supported and helped grow, developing a solid financial framework, or any of an abundance of other possibilities, we all create and embody our living legacy every day. The choice we all get to make is whether it will be intentional or reactive. Will you decide what you want yours to say while we still have the time to author some of its pages, or will you let daily circumstances and the influence of others create it for you?
